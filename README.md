# Scrabble
# The board can draw 7 tiles, restart a game and add up the scores according to the peices on the board. However, I was unable to 
# overlay the drop function on the image so I created my  own board with my own bonus squares. It also highlights the piece when it is 
# placed on the board. However, when i redraw tiles the tiles do not seem to stick to the board for some reason.
